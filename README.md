I have a lot of projects that I'm not willing to expose as a full repo yet, but which would be
useful for demonstrating my experience. Hence the existence of this repo; which should act like
something of a portfolio, consisting of selected, polished snippets for showcasing.

Unless otherwise stated all code in this repository is released under the MIT license. The full
